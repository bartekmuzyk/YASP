# YASP - Yet Another Start Page

YASP is a clean and minimal start page, written entirely in HTML and SCSS, with color themes changed easily through a separate file.

## Color Themes

YASP Comes with support for Catppuccin Mocha, although its easily modifiable through adding a new theme.scss file

You can add your own themes to the repository by contributing with a pull request!
